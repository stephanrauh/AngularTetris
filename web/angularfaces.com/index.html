      AngularFaces combines enterprise level JSF with a well-known, "super-heroic" framework.
      It's designed as an extension to PrimeFaces.<br />
      Currently, there are two different versions of AngularFaces:
      <ul>
      <li>AngularFaces 1.0 is the version that already works. It contains a couple of widgets
      that are derived from PrimeFaces widgets. There's some documentation on <a href="http://www.beyondjava.net/blog">BeyondJava.net</a>
      and the <a href="http://showcase.angularfaces.com">the AngularFaces showcase</a>.
      </li>
      <li>AngularFaces 2.0 is an all-new take on adding AngularJS to JSF. This version blends
      neatlessly into PrimeFaces, but doesn't require PrimeFaces. In theory you can use AngularFaces 2.0 without PrimeFaces
      (but then you have to accept a very limited set of widgets).
      </li>
      </ul>
      What makes AngularFaces 2.0 stand out among other JSF frameworks is it uses it's own ultra-compact DSL to
      generate the JSF pages. After a short initial burst your AngularFaces application causes very
      little network traffic. Of course, Angular reduces network traffic even further.
      <br />
      Oh, and AngularFaces uses Dart as a client side language - a great advantage to Java programmers
      because Dart looks and feels very much like Java (but Java the way it was meant to be :) ).
      <br />
      If you're familiar with Javascript: In a future version there will be also support for Javascript.
      <br />
      Currently, AngularFaces 2.0 is hardly more than a sketch. I expect to finish a running version by the end of summer.

      AngularPrime/Dart is a widget library for AngularDart. It's also the technical basis of AngularFaces.
      <br />
      There are only a few widget libraries for Dart and AngularDart in particular. Some of them
      look very interesting, so I experimented a couple of weeks before deciding AngularFaces deserves
      it's own widget library.
